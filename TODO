##
- some letters like 'C' work but some letters like 'D' don't work with error message
        Error in 1:(dim(points)[1]) : argument of length 0
- when it works for letters make it work for words and arbitrary shapes
- in particular given a list of shape find the outer shape and the inner shapes, 
and then work out the corresponding target log density function
